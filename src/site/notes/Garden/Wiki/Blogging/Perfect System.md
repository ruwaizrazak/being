I've been hunting for a perfect platform to blog since 2018. Yes, I understand that the concept of a perfect tool doesnt exist and a bad worker would complain about the tools rather than his tools.

However, all these being said, I wasnt happy with the options I was having since I migrated away from blogger.com
