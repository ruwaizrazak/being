# UX Engineer, A golden goose?

UX Engineering, a new term that I found out in my journey to learn more about delivering products that would help the people. Or, might I say, “Delivering products that would move the human race forward” as Mr. Jobs would.

I’ve been researching about what I should do to be a UX engineer and as of now, this is what I found out.

- UX Engineers are those who handles front end design solutions, technical prototypes and tooling.
- UX Engineers can also handle Figma UI Components
- Build Animations
- HTML, CSS, JS and typescript

**Now, What am I doing for the same or more than that, why do I want to be a UX engineer?**

This question has always been answered with my need to build products that would help the human race. What kind of product, you may ask? It could be anything, It could merely be a mere todo app to an analog system. What do I know? Im merely a guy who is just curious.
