## Why this analysis?
- I love this game ðŸ¥¸ (As if its not apparent, already)
- The game is being one of the **top downloaded** and one of the **most revenue** making game in FPS genre.![Pasted image 20250201174129.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250201174129.png)


## What are we analyzing here?
1. How the game provides adequate controls for players of different levels?
2. How the game perfected its controls for those who uses different modes of controls at different difficulty level?
3. How the game handles elder player engagement?

These were the questions I had in mind when I was thinking about how and what to analyze the game.

Being said, all these traits, along with the controls, aesthetics and events are keeping the players sticked to the game.

## Game Overview
The game launched in 2019 october 1st and racked up a record breaking **100 Million** **downloads in first week** and **148 million** downloads in the first month.

The aforementioned staggering numbers could be due to multiple factors including the game's advertissation strategies. However the franchise's name the game bears also contributes heavily.

In the [analysis in Deconstructors of fun](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog/2019/11/20/how-call-of-duty-mobile-left-100m-on-the-table), it was stated that the game have an enormous number of downloads in the initial week but not a good number of revenue per download since launch when compared to its competitor PUBG.

However, it is not smooth ride for CODM s the revenue per downloads are almost half compared to PUBG.

While the aforementioned fact remains true the CODM maintains a good retention numbers when compared to the other games in the industry (based on Sensor Tower).

| DAY | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| D1  | 54%   |
| D7  | 27%   |
| D30 | 13%   |
| D60 | 9%    |

The good news about maintaining great retention number is that the long term engagement translates to a steady flow of revenue as Lifetime Value of a retainined user far outweights the immeadiate revenue from a new user.

In the case of call of duty, the active user base gets converted to base users who becomes part of stable MAU of a specific cohort.

In the above image, notice that after a point, the retention curve tends to flatten out which is where the users gets converted to base users and then gets considered as a part of MAU.

## First Impressions
While the game takes the renowned visual language from the ever praised COD franchise among lots of other elements, the game also have a tutorial reminiscent to other games in the franchise where a character, in this case, Simon "Ghost" Riley walks the player through on how to play the game.

### Rules and Goals of the Game
At the simplest form, the game can be mentioned as a last man/team standing game with a military background. But most of you already know that and a lot of the users as well. Thanks to the popularity of the battle royale games.

However, unlike existing games in the franchise, the Call of Duty Mobile has lowered its entry barrier and then slowly raises it as the user progresses. Hence, the game forms a core loop of *Play game -> Gain XP -> Unlock Rewards -> Level up -> Play Game*

The coreloop is then supported with multiple meta loops to cater audience of different motivations and interests, which we will discuss in the following sections.

Apart from the battle royale matches and 5v5 multiplayer matches, the game does not shy away from providing multiple avenues such as "Warfare" to its Audience.

## The Audience
For any product, let that be a game, application, music or even a physical store, Audience is the key factor in deciding its success. Lets take a look at what motivates Call Of Duty Mobile players to get into the game and stay within.

### Motivation Factor

1. Skill Masters
2. Thrill Seekers
3. Networkers
4. King of the Hill
