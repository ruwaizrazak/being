## Why this analysis?
- I love this game ðŸ¥¸ (As if its not apparent, already)
- The game is being one of the **top downloaded** and one of the **most revenue** making game in FPS genre.![Pasted image 20250201174129.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250201174129.png)


## What are we analyzing here?
1. How the game provides adequate controls for players of different levels?
2. How the game perfected its controls for those who uses different modes of controls at different difficulty level?
3. How the game handles elder player engagement?

These were the questions I had in mind when I was thinking about how and what to analyze the game.

Being said, all these traits, along with the controls, aesthetics and events are keeping the players sticked to the game.

## Game Overview
The game launched in 2019 october 1st and racked up a record breaking **100 Million** **downloads in first week** and **148 million** downloads in the first month.

The aforementioned staggering numbers could be due to multiple factors including the game's advertissation strategies. However the franchise's name the game bears also contributes heavily.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FXQ3Pzj.png)


In the [analysis in Deconstructors of fun](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog/2019/11/20/how-call-of-duty-mobile-left-100m-on-the-table), it was stated that the game have an enormous number of downloads in the initial week but not a good number of revenue per download since launch when compared to its competitor PUBG.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vtB6iOl.png)


However, it is not smooth ride for CODM s the revenue per downloads are almost half compared to PUBG.

![](https://i.imgur.com/etJi0py.png)

While the aforementioned fact remains true the CODM maintains a good retention numbers when compared to the other games in the industry (based on Sensor Tower).

| DAY | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| D1  | 54%   |
| D7  | 27%   |
| D30 | 13%   |
| D60 | 9%    |

The good news about maintaining great retention number is that the long term engagement translates to a steady flow of revenue as Lifetime Value of a retainined user far outweights the immeadiate revenue from a new user.

In the case of call of duty, the active user base gets converted to base users who becomes part of stable MAU of a specific cohort.


![](https://i.imgur.com/KcKuDPp.png)

In the above image, notice that after a point, the retention curve tends to flatten out which is where the users gets converted to base users and then gets considered as a part of MAU.

## First Impressions
While the game takes the renowned visual language from the ever praised COD franchise among lots of other elements, the game also have a tutorial reminiscent to other games in the franchise where a character, in this case, Simon "Ghost" Riley walks the player through on how to play the game.

### Rules and Goals of the Game
At the simplest form, the game can be mentioned as a last man/team standing game with a military background. But most of you already know that and a lot of the users as well. Thanks to the popularity of the battle royale games.

However, unlike existing games in the franchise, the Call of Duty Mobile has lowered its entry barrier and then slowly raises it as the user progresses. Hence, the game forms a core loop of *Play game -> Gain XP -> Unlock Rewards -> Level up -> Play Game*


![](https://i.imgur.com/wCeDPN1.png)


The coreloop is then supported with multiple meta loops to cater audience of different motivations and interests, which we will discuss in the following sections.

Apart from the battle royale matches and 5v5 multiplayer matches, the game does not shy away from providing multiple avenues such as "Warfare" to its Audience.

## The Audience
For any product, let that be a game, application, music or even a physical store, Audience is the key factor in deciding its success. Lets take a look at what motivates Call Of Duty Mobile players to get into the game and stay within.

### Motivation Factor
![](https://i.imgur.com/vceh9D8.png)


Even though there are lots of triggers for the users in Call of Duty, the key Archetypes of users can be categorized as:
1. Skill Masters
2. Thrill Seekers
3. Networkers
4. King of the Hill


### Skill Masters

</div>
<div class="textright" style="display:block; margin-top:0; padding:10px;">
<p> Skill masters are the ones who sought to improve themselves over and over and often find themselves in seeking knowledge from several sources including forums, videos and developer documents.</p>
<p>They will be aware about what are the changes happened to each of the weapons in the games for every update </p>
</div>
</div>

### Thrill Seekers

<p> Networkers. Networking during the games were always been in existence using multiple means. There is a certain segment of Call Of Duty users who uses the game to connect with the people they know.</p>
<p>These connection could be the people they knew outside the game or someone who they met through the game and remains within.</p>

### King of the Hill

<div class="parent" style="display:flex; align-items:center;">

</div>
<div class="textright" style="display:block; margin-top:0;padding:10px;">
<p> King of the hill is a shared archetype between most of the PvP games.</p>
<p>These players enjoys the recognition resulting from their competitiveness. They use various identifiers to flaunt their expertise in the game. </p>
<p>A straight example would be the usage of exclusive skins, or chasing Legendary in Ranked mode.<p>
</div>
</div>

While expressionism remains one of the least motivation factor for the users, There are a certain group of user group who is interested in spending for personalization of player skins and weapon skins. 



## Age and Gender distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/b3rBAGX.png)

The age and gender distribution of CODM is in synonym with that of other battleroyale mobile games with Males being a huge population and the age group of 25-44 being the dominant group.

Also, there are no surprises regarding the countries that provide more revenue with the United Status being on top.

## Scientific models behind User Retention

As we are established that the CODM is doing better interms of Retention when compared into other games in the genre. Lets look into existing behaviour models that could serve as a guiding frame work for improving retention.
1. Hook's Model
2. Fogg's Model

While we will explain how these models are being used in CODM, here is an over simplified version of the models to give you a context.
### Hooks Model

<div class="parent" style="display:flex; align-items:center;">
<div class="imageleft">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RazNsmv.png" width=500px; style="padding-top:0;margin-top:0;">
</div>
<div class="textright" style="display:block; margin-top:0;padding:10px;">
<p> Hooked Model conceived by Nir Eyal describes that of a loop consists of four components. </p>

<ol style="margin-left:0;padding-left:0;" ><b>Trigger:</b> Can be Internal or External</ol>
<ol style="margin-left:0;padding-left:0;"><b>Action:</b> Action From the User</ol>
<ol style="margin-left:0;padding-left:0;"><b>Reward:</b> Reward In return of the Action</ol>
<ol style="margin-left:0;padding-left:0;"><b>Investment:</b> Action where user</ol>

</div>
</div>

The above mentioned is an over simplification of Hook's model. If you are interested in learning more about the model, read from the Man himself [here](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/)

### Fogg's model

<div class="parent" style="display:flex; align-items:center;">
<div class="imageleft">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0sbnfqE.png" width=400px; style="padding-top:0;margin-top:0;">
</div>
<div class="textright" style="display:block; margin-top:0;padding:10px;">
<p> The model defines a how a user's Motivation, Ability and Behaviour triggers could lead to target behaviour. </p>
<blockquote>Targeted Behaviour = f(Motivation.Ability.Trigger)</blockquote>
<p>That is, if user have to either work hard to acquire something without possessing enough motivation, the likelyhood of acquiring that is narrow.</p>
</div>
</div>

The paper on the model is very detailed and can be referred [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19LYba4fuceGM3KhqxTXByV4msmb33t1o/view?usp=sharing)

## How does Call of Duty Mobile Attract and Retain users?
Even though there are multiple First Person Shooting games such as PUBG and the prematurely dead Apex Legend Mobile, the CODM is showing tremendous numbers in terms of KPIs and we believe the numbers are coming as a result of Franchise, Aesthetics, Controls, Gameplay, Social and Session Design.

### The Franchise
![](https://i.imgur.com/pchpTou.png)

The call of duty franchise have a huge set of players and considering the targeted Age group of 25-44, The publisher, Timi has considered this heavily. 

The Mobile version is reminiscent of the previous games in the franchise by using the familiar characters, maps and weapons.


<div class="parent" style="display:flex; align-items:center;">
<div class="imageleft">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RZ6I5T4.png" style="padding-top:0;margin-top:0;">
</div>
<div class="textright" style="display:block; margin-top:0;padding:10px;">
<p>The Nostalgia factor is further enhanced by the usage of characters such as Ghost, Price, Frost and even the antagonists.</p>
</div>
</div>

### Aesthetics

Do you know that users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as a design that's more usable? Okay, I didnt say that, but [Aesthetic Usability Effect](https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/) did.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; justify-content: center; background:#fefefe; width:100%; padding:20px;">
	<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
		<div>
		<blockquote style="text-align:left;color:#3a3b36;flex:60%">"An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in peopleâ€™s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better."</blockquote></div>
		
	</div>
</div>

The game despite coming from the franchise, looks greatly like the rest of them boasting a visually pleasing aesthetic. One could often wonder that a device that fits in the hand could run a game that provides console like experience. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/AO9L6CZ.png)


While the game looks astonishing, the developers also considered about making the game accessible to [mid/low level performance](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-gamedev/gamedev-blog/cod.html) devices and provides controls to users over graphics.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lW8lXBr.jpeg)

*Can you believe that these controls are from a mobile game?*

### Controls
The Call of Duty, being an FPS requires frequent and often a combination of inputs to ensure optimal gameplay.

Until PUBGM, the industry has seen FPS games utilizing gamepads or keyboards and one of the crucial aspect when games get ported to mobile devices, is simplifying the controls and while doing so, killing the depth of the game.

The CODM has managed to cater to different level of audience and the levels of control they would require by designing two types of controls
1. Simple Mode
2. Advanced Mode

![](https://i.imgur.com/MQthWsq.jpeg)

With the introduction of these modes, what the developers have essentially done is to create a system that would initially cater the novice player and then to their improved versions who managed to master the controls over a period of time. (*Read more about how that could possibly happen [here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/power-law-learning/)* and [here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-applied-video-games/))

In the advanced mode, the game provides user to set HUD to their preference

<div class="parent" style="display:flex; align-items:center;">
<div class="imageleft" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; padding:10px">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GswRqMg.jpeg" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; min-width:300px;">
<p>Which could start like this. An Abomination, I know :) </p>
</div>
<div class="imageleft" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; padding:10px">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1vvycLC.jpeg" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; min-width:300px;">
<p>To this or whatever way it would make you play better.</p>
</div>
</div>

But an controls isnt everything in an FPS game. To be a good FPS player, one has to master Controls, World Navigation, Target Tracking/Engagement and analyze auditory feedbacks. 

As the game is catered to a set of players who are heavily competitive as mentioned in the Archetypes, the game provides lots of avenues for mastery and as such, Auditory feedbacks are one of them.
