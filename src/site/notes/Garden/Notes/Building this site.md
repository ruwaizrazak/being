Im building this site to mark my journey in acquiring knowledge while seeking self wisdom.

Currently, this site is build using obsidian and [Digital Garden Docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/tips-and-tricks/) and hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) while using [Github](https://github.com/ruwaizrazak/being) as a repository.

I've been planning to build something like this since 2015 after reading [ASD's](https://asd.learnlearn.in/about/) [knowledge aggregator LearnLearn.in](https://learnlearn.in). 

As a first attempt, I tried to follow the guidelines mentioned in the knowledge aggregator and failed miserably due to my lack of understanding in [Docpad](https://docpad.bevry.me)

I then tried multiple platforms, including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com),[Blogger](https://beingrez.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2014-07-30T23:15:00-07:00&max-results=11&start=22&by-date=false) and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and didnt stick on with the same due to following reasons:

## 1. Friction
While all these platforms are great, I'm not a person who could write just like that. Or rather, Im someone who loves to start a thread (or a [seed](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/Digital+Garden+üå±üå≥üçá) in the terms of digital gardenning) from a portable device (read as mobile phone) and then later develop it from the computer.

This is where I had hard time in building using any of these platforms.

Even though, I tried using [Windows Live Writer (Currently Discontinued)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Writer) initially and then moved to jekyll, which I liked, by the way and then moved to something else and never got to settle on a platform.

## 2. Getting inspired
Now, after couple of years (I know, Years...) I finally landed on a random blog which talks about the concept of digital garden and I got intrigued by it, and started searching for how to build a perfect platform and while I understand that the concept of *Perfect* doesnt exist, I started looking for some and what did I found? I found ü•Åü•Åü•Å [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) and through her, I found some others as well including [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) (I will write about it in [[Garden/Notes/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]])

## 3. What am I doing now?
Well, for starters, Im looking at how others are building their portfolio and started collecting the perfect pieces I liked from each of the websites. for eg: I took the wiki structure from [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) and the Garden design from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) and will keep on looking for how to improve the design.
